# Facebook-Poster-WebApp
Create facebooks posts,through a web application, using as an input a Google Sheet
This is just an addon to a "python blog" (the blog part was made following a tutorial)
This is just a proof of concept and not really efficient, a web friendly programming language should be used instead.

## Disclaimer
This might or might not work for you, I really don't plan to maintain it at all.
